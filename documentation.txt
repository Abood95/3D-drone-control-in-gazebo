First I learned to use the socket interface in Python. 
I used i t to send a space character and wait until I get a response
Once I do I continue on reading in an infinite loop
Next I am creating a ros package to hold the node
1. I created the catkin_ws
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
I created a package 
using 
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_create_pkg imu_raw std_msgs geometry_msgs sensor_msgs rospy
Then I created a scripts folder 
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/imu_raw/
$ mkdir scripts
$ cd scripts
I added a file for the node `read_socket.py`
I made it executable using `chmod u+x read_socket.py`
I also added the imu_tools package 
$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ git clone -b melodic https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/imu_tools.git
$ rosdep install imu_tools
Then I ran catkin make
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
I run the complementary filter: 
$ rosrun imu_complementary_filter complementary_filter_node
and my creadted node as:
$ rosrun imu_raw read_sock.py

Now we should have the following up and running: 
roscore 
complementary filter 
read_sock.py

Next open rviz
$rosrun rviz rviz 

in the left panel click "add" and choose imu under rviz_imu_plugin
now you have imu in the left panel. navigate to topic under imu menu and write imu/data (the topic which complementary filter publishes on)

now navigate to global options in the left panel and write imu in the fixed frame option. This should resolve the error you just encountered due to ambigious references.
